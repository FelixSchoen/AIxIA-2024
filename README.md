This repository contains additional resources for our paper

Felix Sch√∂n, Hans Tompits: **On Different Symbolic Music Representations for Algorithmic Composition Approaches based on Neural Sequence Models.** AIxIA 2024.

- ``/code`` contains the code used to train the Transformer models. Note that this directory functions as a snapshot of the code at the moment of submission of the paper and thus contains many aspects that are still work-in-progress for later applications. It serves for reproducability and educational purposes.
- ``/samples`` contains 64 pieces generated by each of the different models in the .mp3 and .midi format as well as the token representation of the pieces.
- ``/survey`` contains the raw answers of all survey participants
- ``/weights`` contains the compressed checkpoints of the trained models. Also contains logs of the training process.

Note that the code for the different tokenisation approaches can be found at the repository of [S-Coda](https://github.com/FelixSchoen/S-Coda/tree/main/scoda/tokenisation), our MIDI processing library.
